# Purpose
The purpose of TermDLL is to create a user and programmer friendly platform that's highly customizable, ranging from a personal utility terminal to a game.

TermDLL is a terminal that is based around a shared library(DLL, .a, .s) that is customizable by any programmer with the appropriate source code. For example, by default TermDLL is a basic pseudo-linux terminal with source code.
